Proof of concept exploring the third dimension and the marching cubes algorithm. 

## Controls 

W A S D - to move the camera in the X and Z axis

LSHIFT and SPACE - to move the camera in the Y axis

THE MOUSE - can now be used to rotate the camera in the X and Y axis

(you do not want to rotate the camera in the Z axis, trust me!)

## On the horizon:

Better performance is the highest priority as of now, and has been for a while...

# Some interesting concepts

--here i will likelt write a short discription of the algorithm

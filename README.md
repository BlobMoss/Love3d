# löve3D
Löve3D is a proof of concept exploring the third dimension and the marching cubes algorithm!

## Controls 

<br>

W A S D - to move the camera in the X and Z axis.

LSHIFT and SPACE - to move the camera in the Y axis.

<br>

THE MOUSE - can now be used to rotate the camera in the X and Y axis.

MOUSE 1 - remove terrain.

MOUSE 2 - add terrain.

SCROLL WHEEL - increase or decrease brush size.

<br>

ESCAPE - to close the program.

<br>

--here i will likely write a short discription of the algorithm
